The values in the precomputed optics file are:

* receptor_dirs - a list of Cartesian coordinates of the unit vectors
  describing the direction of each ommatidium. (N vectors, where N is
  the number of ommatidia.)

* edges - a list of tuples describing the ommatidia contributing to
  each EMD. (M tuples, where M is the number of EMDs and is
  approximately equal to 3*N.)

So, to access these, do::

 import fsee.eye_geometry.switcher
 precomputed = fsee.eye_geometry.switcher.get_module_for_optics(optics='buchner71')

Then, precomputed.receptor_dirs and precomputed.edges are the
variables listed above.
